Before the procedure, time out was performed, the patient was identified, and the procedure was verified. After I obtained informed consent, the scope was passed under direct vision. Throughout the procedure, the patient's blood pressure, pulse, and oxygensaturations were monitored continuously. The Colonoscope was introduced through the anus and advanced to the cecum, identified by appendiceal orifice and ileocecal valve. The colonoscopy was performed without diiiculty. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Procedure and risks explained to patient which include but not limited to medication reaction, bleeding, perforation, aspiration and misssed lesions. Prep was good. Washes and suctioning done as needed also so overall good visualization of mucosa. Slow withdrawal on of scope with careful inspection of mucosa for abnormalities. Judicious gas insuilation used on way in. Gas removal was done as much as possible on way out. . Retroflexion done in the rectum. Scope only advanced when lumen identified. The quality of the bowel preparation was evaluated using the BBPS (Boston Bowel Preparation Scale) with scores of: Right Colon = 3 (entire mucosa seen well with no residual staining, small fragments of stool or opaque liquid), Transverse Colon = 3 (entire mucosa seen well with no residual staining, small fragments of stool or opaque liquid) and Left Colon = 3 (entire mucosa seen well with no residual staining, small fragments of stool or opaque liquid). The total BBPS score equals 9.Findings :-A single localized erosion (proctitis) was found in the distal rectum at the anal verge .. Biopsies were taken with a cold forceps for histology. Estimated blood loss was minimal. -Internal hemorrhoids were found during retroflexion. The hemorrhoids were moderate. -The exam was otherwise without abnormality on direct and retroflexion views.Impression :-A single erosion in the distal rectum.

Informed consent was obtained with risks and benefits explained to the patient. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications The patient was placed in the left lateraldecubitus position. The Olympus endoscope was inserted into the esophagus under direct visualization. It was advanced through the esophagus, into the stomach and through the pylorus to the duodenal bulb and 2nd portion of the duodenum. Careful inspection was made as the endoscope was removed including retroflexion in the stomach. Findings-In the distal esophagus there was an irregular Z-line from 38-39 cm suggestive of Barrett's esophagus. This was examined both white light and narrow band imaging. Biopsies were obtained of the distal esophagus. In the stomach there was mild antral and body gastritis. Biopsies were obtained for H.pylori. There were no ulcers or masses seen. The visualized portion of the duodenal appeared normal without ulcers or inflammation. IMPRESSION : The patient is 55-year-old male with atypical chest pain and right upper quadrant pain. Biopsies today were obtained for H.pylori and Barrett's esophagus. If the patient does Barrett's esophagus and a repeat EGD with biopsy in 6 months will be recommended.Post Operative ImpressionEGD The patient tolerated the procedure without complications.
